# Frontend demo

This is a minimal static HTML page to test the summarize API.

Open `web/index.html` in a browser (or serve with `python -m http.server` in the `web` folder) and set the API endpoint to your deployed API Gateway URL, e.g.: `https://zz6ukqzkoe.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/summarize`.

CORS must be enabled on the API (we added permissive CORS headers by default).
